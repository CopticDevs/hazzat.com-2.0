The Hazzat method is not a new concept, but it has been used by the Coptic Church (mainly the deacons) for a long time.  However, this is the first time to be made into a font.

*The idea is to make the following feasible:*
1. Store all hymns on the computer, instead of papers all around.
2. Be able to share these hymns with friends.
3. Post these hymns on the internet for teaching.
4. Make it look nice and uniform.
5. Set a standard for other fonts for the same purpose.
